## HTML Page

The HTML page was built using only HTML and CSS. I used `display: grid` to lay out the emojis and `keyframes` to create the animations.

## Inspiration and Process Documentation

I wasn't entirely sure about what to make for this first assignment so I settled on some shrugging emojis, really encapsulating the current vibe over here.
