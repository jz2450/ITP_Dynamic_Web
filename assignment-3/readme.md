## Sketching, Wireframes, and Design

No sketch this week because I'm drowing in thesis work.

## Development

This page was made using functiona programming in TS although the types involved in this project were almost always Promises and Strings with the occasional JSON. I used Binary Jazz's [Genrenator API](https://binaryjazz.us/genrenator-api/) which does not require an API Key. My interactive element is a button that refreshes and gets a new genre to explore!
